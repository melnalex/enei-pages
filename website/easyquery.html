                    <p class="smaller-text" >ANY data processing in a database application usually begins and ends at the presentation level. The user asks the system for some data, this "request" is converted into a query (or several queries) to the database, we receive data from there, process it, format it if necessary and send it back for display in the UI.</p>

                    <p class="smaller-text">
                        In many projects, the number of parameters by which you can search for data is in the tens or even hundreds. EasyQuery provides a unified and easy-to-use UI for building complex queries on many parameters, converting them into database queries and displaying results.

                        EasyQuery includes many visual components both to build complex queries and to display the results of those queries in all possible variations. It includes different widgets that represent the query (QueryPanel, ColumnsPanel, etc), a multifunctional table (grid) to display the result, pagination controls, aggregation and grouping UI, charts, dashboards, ad-hoc reporting components and many other UI widgets.
